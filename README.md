# rps-game

This is a project in which a user can select rock, paper or scissors and expect a varied response from the computer in order to carry out the game. It should be randomised each time for a fair experience and display a winner or loser message upon completion.

Once either the player or the computer reaches 10 points, the game will end and a final winner will be declared.

The user can press the reset button to start over.
